# wc3gymnasium
Customizable build order overlay for Warcraft III Reforged melee players.


## Installation:
###	latest v0.4 - [download](https://github.com/cegees/wc3gymnasium/raw/refs/heads/main/release.zip)

Run wc3gymnasium.exe from anywhere
Save the build orders in the same folder as wc3gymnasium.exe.


Download build orders from [build-orders](https://github.com/cegees/wc3gymnasium/tree/main/build-orders) and or make your own!

Create/copy-paste build orders as plain text files saved with .md extension. wc3gymnasium will search for .md in the directory the exe is located in.

I recommend using many line breaks and few words as needed to keep the window narrow as possible. Word wrap is supported and markdown or other syntax planned soon. 
	Instead of saying "Send 4 peasants gold mine," it's easier to quickly understand "4 peasants mine"  
Consider practicing the build order in single player, then use list as a quick reference online.  


#### Please share build orders you make! I will include them in the builds folder.

## Features:
	- Slider for window transparency.
	- Keyboard emoji (‚å®) button to bind key to enable overlay mode as seen with in-game screenshot.
	- Change font size with ‚ûï‚ûñ buttons.
	- Toggle light/dark theme with ‚òØ button
	- Timer with pause/play(‚èØÔ∏è) and reset to 0:00(üîÑ) buttons.


There are a lot of new players wanting to learn melee and this game is very complex. Timely execution of a build can be 100s of MMR difference, regardless of micro. I've been playing War3 since day 1 and this has improved my melee play a lot!


## Future plans:
	- markdown? syntax support 
	- timer sync with current Wc3 match time
	- race specific UI option
 	- nicely formatted builds database hosted online
  	- mini web browser pop up with full build details
