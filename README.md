# wc3gymnasium
Build order overlay for Warcraft III melee.




## Installation
###	current version v0.1 - download 

Run wc3gymnasium.exe from anywhere, (or clone repo and 'python wc3gymnasium.py')

Copy/create build orders as plain text files saved with .md extension in: 
	`C:\wc3gymnasium\`
I recommend using many line breaks and few words as needed to keep the window narrow as possible. 
Consider first practicing the build order in single player, then use list as a reference online.  Please share build orders you make.


There are a lot of new players wanting to learn melee and this game is very complex. Timely executing a build order can be 100s of MMR difference regardless of micro. I've been playing War3 since day 1 and this has improved my melee play a lot!


## Coming soon:
	- markdown support 
	- transparency and "invisible" overlay mode
	- timer sync with current Wc3 match time
	- race specific UI
