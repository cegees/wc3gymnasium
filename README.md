# wc3gymnasium
Customizable build order overlay for Warcraft III Reforged melee players.


## Installation
###	latest v0.1 - [download](https://github.com/cegees/wc3gymnasium/raw/main/wc3gymnasium.exe)

Run wc3gymnasium.exe from anywhere, (or run via 'python wc3gymnasium.py' to first check the ugly source code)

Copy/create build orders as plain text files saved with .md extension in: 
	`C:\wc3gymnasium\`
I recommend using many line breaks and few words as needed to keep the window narrow as possible. 
Consider first practicing the build order in single player, then use list as a reference online.  

Please share build orders you make! I have included them in the builds folder.


There are a lot of new players wanting to learn melee and this game is very complex. Timely executing a build order can be 100s of MMR difference regardless of micro. I've been playing War3 since day 1 and this has improved my melee play a lot!


## Coming soon:
	- markdown syntax support 
	- transparency and "invisible" overlay mode
	- timer sync with current Wc3 match time
	- race specific UI
 	- nicely formatted builds database hosted online
  	- mini web browser pop up with full build details
