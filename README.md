# wc3gymnasium
Customizable build order overlay for Warcraft III Reforged melee players.


## Installation:
###	latest v0.2.1 - [download](https://github.com/cegees/wc3gymnasium/raw/main/wc3gymnasium(v0.2.1).exe)

Run wc3gymnasium.exe from anywhere, (or run 'python wc3gymnasium.py')
Download build orders from [build-orders](https://github.com/cegees/wc3gymnasium/tree/main/build-orders) and or make your own! Save the files in the same folder as wc3gymnasium.exe.

Create/copy-paste build orders as plain text files saved with .md extension. wc3gymnasium will search for .md in the directory the exe is located in as well as
	`C:\wc3gymnasium\`
I recommend using many line breaks and few words as needed to keep the window narrow as possible. Word wrap is supported and markdown or other syntax planned soon. 
	Instead of saying "Send 4 peasants gold mine," it's easier to quickly understand "4 peasants mine"  
Consider practicing the build order in single player, then use list as a quick reference online.  


Please share build orders you make! I have included them in the builds folder.


There are a lot of new players wanting to learn melee and this game is very complex. Timely execution of a build can be 100s of MMR difference, regardless of micro. I've been playing War3 since day 1 and this has improved my melee play a lot!


## Future plans:
	- markdown syntax support 
	- "click through" overlay mode (I dont know how to do this in python)
	- timer sync with current Wc3 match time
	- race specific UI
 	- nicely formatted builds database hosted online
  	- mini web browser pop up with full build details
