4v4 HU Paladin/Bloodmage - Rifleman : 
This simple yet powerful strategy is effective in solo and team games. Paladin has always been a great hero, but especially in 4v4 where he has multiple heroes to heal and teammates to bolster with Devotion Aura. 
The build order is 3 Peasants to gold, 2 to lumber. Train 2 Peasants to complete your gold line. At 210 lumber, build a Blacksmith -> Barracks -> Farm -> Altar -> Farm. You should have at least 4 or 5 Rifleman and 10+ Peasants on lumber before teching (so that you can expand simultaneously). I like to add a 2nd Barracks after expanding and teching. The Tier 2 range upgrade is key, as is getting 2/2 upgrades asap. Bloodmage added 2nd is great because of Mana Siphon. You can choose to play Banish to combo with Holy Light for 1.5x effectiveness, or you can play Flamestrike. I'll usually skill Siphon/Flame/Flame/Siphon/Flame with Bloodmage second. This strategy is especially effective on small maps or a map like Marketsquare. You can add Knights, Mortar Teams, Gryphons, or Flying Machines based on the situation; or simply mass 70-80 food Rifleman with 3/3 upgrades. Paladin should skill Holy Light/Devotion aura.
