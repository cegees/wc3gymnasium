4v4 HU AM/Bloodmage/Paladin - Mortars/Flying Machines/Siege Engines : 
I don't often play this style but it is effective in 4v4 as long as you have decent teammates with significant armies. Blizzard and Flamestrike can be absurdly strong in some cases, as can upgraded Mortar Teams in the back lines as long as they are protected. It's never a bad idea to have anti air, and Flying Machines are great at it as long as you have 12-18+. Siege Engines are effective against light air units and of course against buildings. As the player who typically is the "carry" on my team, having someone play this strategy in a support role is very good. While playing a support role can be the most important part of a team, it is also vulnerable in the fact that rarely will you be able to defend in a 1v1 situation late game. Keep this in mind if playing a support role and adapt accordingly.
