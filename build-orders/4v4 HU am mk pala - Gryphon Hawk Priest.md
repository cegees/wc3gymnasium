4v4 HU AM/MK/Paladin - Gryphon/Hawk/Priest :
This is my go-to strategy on maps like Northshire or Gold Rush. This is a fast expo friendly strategy that is great on larger maps with easy expansions. The best way to fast expand as Human with optimal macro is to creep a green camp first before calling militia to expand, reason being it gives your peasants more time to gather lumber and allows you to tech and expand simultaneously. Once my Archmage is level 3 (and I have purchased a Goblin Shredder on maps that it is available) I will run to my opponent's expansion areas to cancel or harass their expos. At Tier 2, add 3x Gryphon Aviary and 1x Arcane Sanctuary while teching to Tier 3. You can make some Breakers or Hawks in the mean time if you need units or simply more Footmen. Footmen are good in 4s with Defend. Research Adept and Master Priests. At Tier 3 you should have AM/MK/Paladin, pick up a staff and research Master Priest, Animal War Training, and Storm Hammers. You can break upkeep into a strong 80 food army of Gryphon/Hawk/Priest.
