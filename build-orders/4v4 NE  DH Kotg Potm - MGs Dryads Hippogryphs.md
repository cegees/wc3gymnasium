4v4 NE  DH/Kotg/Potm - Mountain Giants/Dryads/Hippogryphs: This is a strategy that I will deploy on small maps, or those without easy expansions. Mountain Giants are effective in 4s but only to a certain extent. I believe the best way to utilize MGs in 4v4 is to combine them with a group of Hippogryphs for anti-air plus a few Dryads and a Bear for Roar. You'll still want to AoW creep and expand, but you can also train less archers here (around 4). 
At Tier 2, add 2x Ancient of Lores and 1x Ancient of Wind. You can start making some Dryads early on to compliment your Archers while teching to Tier 3. The Hippogryphs are an important piece to this strategy because without them you lack much DPS. Don't mass Dryads. The ideal army here is something like 2-4 MGs, 6-12 Hippogryphs, 2-4 Dryads, and 1 Bear. Equip an Orb of Poison on your DH and complete the researches for Mountain Giants. I choose to play the classic hero combo of DH/Kotg/Potm here because of its synergy with Lore units, where as Tavern heroes like DR, Panda, or Alchemist play best with Chippo.
