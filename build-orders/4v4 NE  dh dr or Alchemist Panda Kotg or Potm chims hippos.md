4v4 NE  dh, dr, or Alchemist/Panda/Kotg or Potm - 
"Chippo" (Chimeras/Hippogryphs) : I prefer this strategy on maps like Sanctuary or Twilight Ruins. This is the "carry" strategy to dominate and get high level heroes. The choice between starting heroes is based on your preference. I prefer Dark Ranger on maps like Sanctuary or Gold Rush (easy expansions, many low HP creeps). Level 3 Silence is also ridiculous. DH and Alchemist are interchangeable; both scale very well as the game progresses and are excellent primary heroes. Panda is terrific here, and you can choose between Kotg or Potm third as your utility hero. 
The build order is the same (AoW creeping and expanding), but you'll build less Archers during your tech. At Tier 2, I add 2x Ancient of Winds and start producing and researching Druid of the Talons. At Tier 3, add 3x Chim Roosts and consider adding a 3rd or even 4th Ancient of Wind if you have multiple expos. You should try to get a second expansion on maps that have them available (ex: Sanctuary, Gold Rush). While Chimeras are absolutely dominant, be sure to have enough Hippogryphs to counter opposing air forces and to protect your Chims. I like to have 2-4 Druid of the Talon as well (ground form) to Cyclone heroes but it isn't necessary. One Bear for Roar is also a great addition.
