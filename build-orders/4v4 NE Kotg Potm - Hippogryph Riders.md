4v4 NE Kotg/Potm - Hippogryph Riders :
It comes at no surprise that the Keeper of the Grove is also a great hero in 4s. I like to AoW creep out my early expansion with Kotg and Archers. Be careful to build your AoW far enough away from creeps as to not aggro them (the creep camps on 4s maps are generally more aggressive). You should build Moon Wells and a 2nd AoW once you are at 20/20 food and your first AoW is creeping. After you are finished AoW creeping, move it to the next spot while producing archers from your 2nd AoW. This strategy allows for a quick expansion and tech while having a strong early army in Kotg and Archers. Often times I will root my 2nd AoW eventually and produce many Archers, while adding 2x Ancient of Winds and producing Hippogryphs. Hippogryph Riders are very good in 4v4 as they are fast and versatile flying units. Depending on the amount of opposing air units, my army will often look like 2 Heroes, 10 Hippo Riders, and 6-8 Hippogryphs. Keep your heroes alive and try not to accidentally run into an opposing group of Fiends.
