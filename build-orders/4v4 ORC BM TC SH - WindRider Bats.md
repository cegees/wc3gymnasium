4v4 ORC BM/TC/SH - Wind Rider/Bats : 
This is my go-to strategy whenever I get Orc and spawn in the middle of my team (meaning in between two of my teammates). In this case, you can safely fast tech without a Barracks. If you are on the outside, however; teching without a Barracks can be fatal if you face early pressure in your main. 
The build order is simply Altar + Burrow and a Voodoo Lounge, while making 8-9 Peons on lumber before teching. The strength in this combination is in scouting, map control, and hero killing. "Hexastomp" is the rotation of Stomp and Hex that can take down any hero if executed well. As the game progresses and your heroes level to 5/5/5+, you'll become a significant threat. Bat Riders are great in 4v4 both as anti-air units and to destroy bases/expansions. I like to stay 50 food with a few Wind Riders and 3 heroes for awhile and eventually break upkeep into Bats. This is one strategy where you won't want to fast expand, but rather tech to Tier 3 quickly and grab a Fast Expo item from the shop.
