4v4 ORC alchemist or DR + tc/sh - Headhunters/Tauren/Caster :
This is a FFA-inspired strategy that can straight up dominate in 4v4. DR and Headhunters creep your early expansion very quick and you can add Spirit Lodges and Tauren Totems at Tier 2. You'll want to have enough Headhunters to fight anti-air unless your teammates are heavy on AA. Tauren are good in 4v4 but I rarely will make more than 2 or 3 due to the amount of opposing air units that are likely to be seen. With that being said, some times it is very strong to go for Grunts -> Tauren/Caster, as long as your teammates have significant AA. Orc's greatest strength in 4v4 is the Shaman. Bloodlust is incredibly strong on heavy units and requires almost zero micro to use. A Bloodlusted army in 4v4 that "attack-moves" will typically crush an opposing force even if they have superior micro. For these reasons, be sure to make 4-5+ Master Shaman if you don't have another Orc teammate who will. When I get Orc, the first thing I do is check my teammates to see if there is another Orc and ask if he plans to get Shaman. As the game progresses, your army should have a Kodo Beast, 4+ Shaman, 3+ Witch Doctor and 2+ Walkers.
