# ARCHMAGE ONE CAMP INTO EXPO

T1: Make a peasant. Constantly produce them. 
- 4 peasants mine gold
- 1 peasant builds an altar
First four peasants as they spawn:
- Barracks
- Farm
- Mine gold
- Farm
*10/18:* Altar finishes: Archmage
*16/18:* Barracks finishes: Footman. Constantly produce them.
*18/18:* build 3rd Farm, @ 20 lumber.
*21/24:* First footman -- scout the enemy.
*22/24:* Before Archmage spawns, start first creep camp w/ 3 militia, join with Archmage and 2nd footman.
*27/30:* When halfway finished with first camp, send 5 new militia to future expo. Join forces asap.
*28/30:* Stop making Footmen and Peasants. You should have 15 peasants (5 on gold, 5 on lumber, 5 creeping expansion), 4 footmen, 1 Archmage.
*28/30:* After creeping the expansion construct a Town Hall with 4 peasants, and a Scout Tower with 1 peasant. Upgrade the scout tower to an arcane tower when it finishes.
*28/30:* Make peasants if you expect to be harassed, or a 5th footman if you want to be aggressive. When in doubt: Make peasants.

## Notes:
- Defend expo with 2-3 militia from main base
- Queue 2-3 peasants to replace the militia, (lumber economy support)
- When their militia timer expires, use the peasants to build your expansion town hall, replacing the peasants you lost to the enemy’s attack.
- When you have 210 lumber, start teching to Keep in your main base.
Continue producing peasants at your expansion until you have 12 total on lumber, spread between your main and expansion.
- Build a Lumber Mill in your main base, power build it with 3 peasants. Research Improved Lumber Harvesting as soon as the Lumber Mill finishes.
- Start researching Defend, then resume footmen production.
Upgrade the scout tower at your expansion to a guard tower, and the scout tower in your main to an arcane tower.
- Build an Arcane Vault, Blacksmith, and two Farms.
- The number of footmen you need is situational, but don’t go above 45 food, so you can fit in a second hero without breaking upkeep.

## Benchmark
`You should be able to start your expansion before nightfall of the first day, which is 18:00 in-game time. Your tech timing will depend heavily on the number of peasants you lose, but anything before midnight (24:00) in game is good.`
